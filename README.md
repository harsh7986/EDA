# ðŸ“‘ Titanic Dataset EDA â€” Summary of Findings

### 1. **Dataset Overview**
- The dataset contains information about **891 passengers** including demographics, class, fare, survival status, and more.
- Some columns have missing data, notably `age` and `deck`.

---

### 2. **Key Observations**

**Passenger Demographics:**
- **Gender:** There are **more male passengers** than female passengers.
- **Class:** The **majority** of passengers traveled in **Third Class (3rd class)**.
- **Age:** 
  - Most passengers were aged **20â€“30 years**.
  - There are **outliers** (passengers older than 70).

**Survival Analysis:**
- **Gender:** 
  - **Females had a significantly higher survival rate** compared to males.
  - A much larger proportion of women survived.
- **Class:**
  - **First-class passengers** had the highest survival rates.
  - **Third-class passengers** had the lowest survival rates.
- **Age:**
  - Younger passengers (especially children) had better survival rates.
  
**Fare:**
- Higher fares were slightly associated with a higher chance of survival (passengers in first class paid higher fares).

---

### 3. **Correlation Insights**
- Positive correlation between **fare** and **survival**.
- **Passenger class** negatively correlated with survival (lower class = lower survival rate).
- Other numerical features have weaker correlations.

---

### 4. **Handling Missing Data**
- Filled missing `age` values with the **median age**.
- Dropped the `deck` column due to **excessive missing values**.

---

# âœ¨ Final Takeaways:
- **Women and children** were prioritized during rescue.
- **Socioeconomic status** (reflected in passenger class) **strongly impacted survival**.
- **Age and Fare** had modest but noticeable effects on the chances of survival.
